# Towards a Form Based Dynamic Database Schema Creation and Modiﬁcation System
基于表单的动态数据库模式创建与修改系统

## 摘要
 The traditional approach to relational database design starts with the conceptual design of an application based schema in a model like the Entity-relationship model, then mapping that to a logical design and eventually representing it as a set of related normalized tables. The project we present has been motivated by needs of healthcare-IT wheresmall group practices are currently in need of systems that will cater to their dynamic requirements without depending on EMR (ElectronicMedical Record) systems. It is also relevant for researchers for mining huge repositories of data such as social networks, etc. and create extracts of data on the ﬂy for data analytics. Based on user characteristics and needs, the data is likely to vary and hence, a dynamic back-end database must be created. This paper addresses a form-based approach to schema creation and modiﬁcation.
传统的关系型数据库的设计方法首先对应用程序的模式(这些模式属于一个模型，例如实体-关系模型)进行概念设计，然后将其映射成逻辑设计，最终表示成一组相关的规范化表。我们提出的项目一直搜到医疗保健需求的推动。目前，小组实践所需要的系统能够满足其动态需求，而不依赖于EMR(电子医疗系统)。 研究人员还可以挖掘庞大的数据存储库（如社交网络等），并为了做数据分析可以创建数据抽取。 根据用户特征和需求，数据可能会有所不同，因此必须创建动态后端数据库。 本文讨论了基于表单的模式创建和修改方法。
## 1.介绍
It has been observed that a database schema frequently experiences a lot of changes with time [13]. In most of the domains, there is a lack of a set of common data elements, that users would like to store in the database thus requiring diﬀerent database schemas. In such cases, a static database schema would pose a problem. One approach to modifying the schema would be to have a databasea dministrator track the data elements and periodically modify the schema. This would require a lot of manual labor and periodic updates would eventually delay data entry. In most large organizations, the DBA staﬀ has been entrusted with dealing with schema management however the costs associated with database management systems and other large-scale application systems such as EMR(Electronic Medical Record) systems tend to be prohibitive for most “small-business”, or start-up operations. For most small outﬁts dealing with a specialty practice with a handful of physicians, adopting large generic systems is prohibitive in adoption, training and maintenance costs. We propose an approachin this paper to:
据观察，数据库模式经常会随着时间的推移而经历很多变化[13]。在大多数领域，缺少一组公共数据元素，用户希望将这些元素存储在数据库中，因此需要不同的数据库模式。在这种情况下，静态数据库模式会产生问题。
修改模式的一种方法是让数据库管理员跟踪数据元素并定期修改模式。这将需要大量的手工劳动，定期更新最终会延迟数据输入。在多数大型组织中，DBA被委托处理模式管理，但与数据库管理系统和其他大规模应用系统（如EMR（电子医疗记录）系统）相关的成本往往对大多数“小型企业或者创业”而言过高。对于大多数处理少数医生专业实践的小型企业，采用大型通用系统在采用、培训和维护成本方面是过高的。我们在本文中提出了一种方法：

1. Create schemas based on predefined forms
2. Update and customize schemas as per changing user needs
3. Align the back-end storage of data as the schemas evolve

1. 基于预定义的表单创建模式
2. 根据用户需求的变化更新和定制模式
3. 在模式的发展时，自动对齐数据的后端存储

Our primary goal is to reduce user intervention and to let the database “evolve” consistently as time progresses. For developing a generically applicable system, we base it on the relational model. Our approach to dynamic schema creation and management has been described here in the context of healthcare just for illustrative purposes. This project was motivated by our interaction with a local neurosurgery practice through Dr.Laborde, a neurosurgeon, who convinced us that there is merit to developing approached to “ad-hoc” database creation and management for applications where elaborate and costly solutions like EMR and EHR (Electronic Health Record) systems are an overkill.

我们的首要目标是减少用户介入，并随着时间发展让数据库不断发展。为了开发一个通用的系统，我们将其建立在关系模型上。为了说明这一个目的，我们再医疗保健的背景下描述了我们的动态模式创建和管理方法。
神经外科医生Dr.Laborde与当地神经外科实践的互动推动了这个项目，他使我们相信，开发接近“ad-hoc”数据库创建和管理的应用程序是值得的，跟这个程序相比，复杂而昂贵的解决方案比如EHR(电子健康记录)是过度多余的

We made some assumptions while developing the prototype. Our current implementation has been designed to cater to clinical researchers and physicians who want to use existing data for clinical trials and studies and want to add some parameters of their own. Very little knowledge about database modeling and query languages is assumed. The forms could then be made available to the end users such as patients. The users (physicians, nurses, etc. but not patients)are provided with predeﬁned forms developed based on the underlying database schema. These forms are automatically generated based on the metadata, which is stored in a separate database. This process is discussed later in the paper.

我们开发原型时做了一些假设。我们当前实现旨在满足临床研究人员和医生的需求，他们希望将现有数据用户临床试验和研究，并希望增加自己的参数。关于数据库建模和查询语言的知识极少。然后将这些表格提供给最终用户，比如病人。这些用户(）被提供了预定义的表格，这些表格是基于底层数据库模式开发的。
这些表格是根据元数据自动生成，这些元数据存储在一个单独的数据库。该过程将在本文后面讨论：

The users can customize these existing forms by adding and deleting data elements of their choice. As a result of this the tables in underlying database will undergo appropriate schema modiﬁcations as discussed later in the paper. In our test implementation, we have used a neurosurgery application database from a local clinic called the ALIF (Anterior Lumbar Inter-body fusion) database [10].We dealt with the ALIF data with Dr.Laborde’s expertise as a domain expert in the speciﬁc specialty which deals with surgical procedures of the spine. The term “user” will apply to physicians , nurses, researchers etc. who are knowledgeable about the application domain, who can evaluate the suitability of existing forms and who can be guided in their choices when they undertake to modify the forms.Totally naive end users will not be a target audience for our approach。
用户可以通过添加和删除他们选择的数据元素自定义这些现有表单。因此底层数据库的表将会经历适当的模式修改，如本文后面所述。
在我们测试实现中，我们使用了一个神经应用功能程序数据库，这个数据库来自于当地诊所，称为ALIF(前腰椎体间融合)数据库。我们使用Dr.Laborde的专家知识处理ALIF数据，？？？？。
用户这个词适用于医生、护士、研究人员，他们对应用领域有所了解，可以评估现有表格的实用性，当他们需要修改表单时能够指导他们的选择。完全天真的终端用户不是我们方法的目标受众。

## 2.Technical Challenges and Claims 技术挑战和声明

One of the major challenges we faced while developing this system was to avoid anomalies or inconsistencies at the back-end when the user makes changes to the forms provided for entering the data. The traditional approach to constructing a relational database application involves building a conceptual schema of the relational database using a model like the extended entity-relationship model and then constructing a relational database schema [12]. For most advanced applications the schema of the relational database changes during development. We are interested in providing a solution to environments where the database schema needs to be adjusted in real time keeping all constraints and rules of a relational database intact while the user makes changes to the existing forms or creates new forms. This involves maintaining a metadata database to store metadata about the forms (FORMS DATABASE) and a domain speciﬁc database (DSD)to store the actual data entered by the user. The system also provides an easy to use Form Field Selection feature, which can be used by novice users to build their own forms

我们开发这个系统面临的主要挑战之一是，当用户录入数据时会修改这些表单，这种情况下如何避免后端出现异常和不一致。构建关系型数据库应用的传统方法包括：使用一个模型(如可扩展的实体-关系模型)构建一个关系数据库的概念模式，然后构建一个关系数据库模式。
对于大多数高级应用程序，关系数据库的模式在开发阶段会改变。我们感兴趣的是为需要实时调整数据库模式的环境提供解决方案，当用户修改现有表单或者创建新表单，保持关系型数据库的所有约束和规则不变。这包含维护一个存储表单元数据的元数据库，一个存储用户输入实际数据的域特定数据库(DSD)。这个系统还提供易于使用的表单字段选择器功能，新手用户可以使用它构建自己的表单。

## 8.Data Retrieval: Query Creation and Validation 数据检索：查询创建和验证
The system also supports data retrieval by giving the user a choice of either selecting existing result sets previously created by users or creating his own. The user is presented with four types of operations namely ‘Select’, ‘Aggregation’, ‘Group By’ and ‘Having’ to build a query.

这个系统也支持数据检索，方法是让用户选择先前用户创建的现有的结果集或者创建自己的结果集。用户可以使用四个类型的操作符来构建一个查询：Select、Aggregation、Group By、Having。

1. Select Operation
The user can select fields, which need to be displayed together in the result set. This may be done by selecting a table from a drop down list and on doing so the corresponding attributes of the selected table would be shown.
用户可以选择字段，这些字段可以显示在结果集中。可以通过一个下拉列表完成选择，然后选择表的对应属性将会显示出来。

2. Aggregation Operation
The operation may be used by user to perform aggregate functions like
COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, etc on the fields.
用户可以使用这个操作执行聚合函数，例如COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG等

3. Group By and Having Operation
If the user decides to use the Aggregation operation then the ‘Group By’ and ‘Having’ operations would be enabled. Using them the aggregated results may be grouped with respect to certain fields which may or may not be based on some condition.

如果用户决定使用聚合操作，则讲启用‘Group By’ and ‘Having’ 操作。通过使用它们，可以将针对某些字段对聚合结果进行分组，这些字段可以基于某些条件，也可以不基于某些条件。


## 8.Discussion and Conclusion 讨论和结论
### 8.1 Why not NoSQL?
A lot of organizations which collect vast amounts of customer, scientific, sales data have traditionally stored data in a relational structure, but recently some of these organizations are tending to use various types of non-relational databases called NoSQL databases since they have been found to be efficient in handling unstructured data where there is no fixed schema [8]. In our case we also have a schema that is flexible since the user can modify it based on his requirement, but we chose not to go for NoSQL due to the following reasons.

一些采集大量客户、科学、销售数据的组织，传统的处理方式是以关系结构存储数据，但是近来这些组织倾向与使用多种非关系数据，成为NoSQL，由于没有固定的schema,NoSQL在处理非结构化数据时非常高效的。在我们例子中，我们使用了模式，用户可以基于他们的需求灵活修改，但是我们没有选择NoSQL是基于下列原因：

1. Consistency, availability, and partition tolerance are the three properties taken into consideration when designing a database system. According to the CAP theorem [2] it is only possible to have two out of these three properties together in a database system at once. Traditional relational databases maintain consistency and availability but have trouble with partitions whereas NoSQL databases are able to maintain either consistency or availability along with partition tolerance. In our case the main goal of the system is providing the user with all the data in a consistent state and available in user’s expected form.

一致性、可用性、分区容忍性是设计数据库系统时考虑的3个方面。根据CAP理论，在一个数据库系统只能同时拥有两个属性。传统的关系数据库保持了一致性和可用性，牺牲了分区容忍性，但是NoSQL数据库在保持分区容忍性时要么保证一致性，要么保证可用性。在我们的用例中，系统的主要目标是保证所有数据的一致性和可用性，并以用户期望的表单形式提供。

2. The primary goal of our system is to add flexibility to existing schemas and dynamically modify them. Since most of the healthcare databases have a relational structure at the back-end, we formulated our approach using relational databases.
我们系统的首要目标是为现有模式增加灵活性并动态修改它们。由于大部分医疗保健数据库在后端都有关系结构，我们使用关系数据库制定了我们方法
